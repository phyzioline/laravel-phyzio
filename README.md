## Future Development

This project is prepared for future mobile app development with Python (Flutter backend/API integration).

## Dashboard Role Separation & Payments 🔒

- Implemented resource policies for payments and vendor payouts in `app/Policies` (`PaymentPolicy`, `VendorPaymentPolicy`).
- Policies are registered in `app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php`.
- Dashboard controllers now scope queries by authenticated user where appropriate (e.g., therapist dashboards use `therapist_id`, vendor dashboards use `vendor_id`).
- Feature tests added: `tests/Feature/Dashboard/PaymentAuthorizationTest.php` to verify data isolation and admin access.
- Recommendation: Add gateway webhook handlers to confirm external payment status before creating `Payment` records in production.

## Google Merchant Feed

We expose localized product feeds for Google Merchant Center. Two public feeds are available:

- `/google-merchant-en.xml` — English feed
- `/google-merchant-ar.xml` — Arabic feed

Notes:
- Google requires product data in the target language and currency; submit the feed corresponding to the country/language you target.
- Feed entries include localized title/description, localized product link (with locale), absolute image URLs, price (EGP), availability and `sku` as `mpn`.
- To clear caches on deployment run:

```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```
